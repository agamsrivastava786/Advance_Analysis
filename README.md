# Wipro Stock Analysis

This project performs a comprehensive data analysis of Wipro stock data obtained from Kaggle, leveraging Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, and DateTime.  The analysis encompasses risk assessment, time series analysis, and various data visualization techniques.

**Project Overview:**

This project aims to gain insights into Wipro's stock performance through a combination of statistical analysis and visualization.  Key areas explored include:

* **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:**  The raw dataset is cleaned and preprocessed using Pandas to handle missing values, inconsistencies, and prepare the data for analysis.
* **Time Series Analysis:**  Time series techniques are applied to understand trends, seasonality, and other temporal patterns in the stock data. This may include analyzing moving averages, identifying trends, and potentially forecasting future stock prices (depending on the scope of the project).
* **Risk Analysis:**  Risk assessment is performed to evaluate the volatility and potential risks associated with investing in Wipro stock. This could involve calculating metrics like standard deviation, Sharpe ratio, or other relevant risk indicators.
* **Data Visualization:**  Matplotlib and Seaborn are used to create informative visualizations, including:
    * **Heatmaps:** To visualize correlations between different variables.
    * **Time Series Plots:** To illustrate stock price movements over time.
    * **Other relevant plots:**  Such as histograms, box plots, scatter plots, etc., to explore the data from different perspectives.
* **Libraries Used:**
    * NumPy: For numerical computations.
    * Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
    * Seaborn: For statistical data visualization.
    * Matplotlib: For creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations.
    * DateTime: For working with date and time data.

**Dataset:**

The Wipro stock dataset used in this project was sourced from Kaggle.  (Provide a link to the Kaggle dataset if possible).
